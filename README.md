# Exploratory-Analysis-of-Crime-Data
## Problem Statement
What do we do when we want to move into a new neighborhood in the United States? Selecting the right neighborhood is essential for kids to go to school in a safe place, for business to thrive in a safe environment and that we all as a society feel secure however late in the night it might be in the locality.

# Project Objective
we are using data provided by the open source LA county department government website and creating analysis and scatter plots using GGplot, ggmap packages in the Los Angeles area as they contribute to almost 60% of the Countries crime. This data has been employed to correlate the demography of the crime with the neighborhood and the types of the crime being committed. Another correlation links time at which crime occurs to the address of the crime scene. Moreover, based on this data, a relational scale can be introduced in the website which prevents individuals from starting business ventures or schools in these localities.
